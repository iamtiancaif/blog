A rough estimation about memory overhead
========================================

conclusion first
----------------

28000 sockets consume 70M memory of Old Generation.

2661.800285714 Byte per socket

**simple calculation**

161316040 Bytes, before connecting,  
235846448 Bytes, after connected and holding.  
28000	  connections.  

2661.800285714 = (235846448âˆ’161316040) / 28000

## train of thought
1. Large Old Generation only get increased and never reclaimed.
2. A server do nothing but only accpect and hold connections, based on netty.
3. A client do nothing but only request and hold connections, based on netty too.
4. Boot client to connect to server with thousands of sockets, hold on a minute, then stop client.  
5. Repeat step 4 several times and record the gc state each time. 


Cause each time the calculation as **simple calculation** resulted in the nearly same value, I just present the last time I did. The following:
